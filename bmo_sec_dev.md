## Experience with Host Intrusion Prevention and Vulnerability management technologies

- A HIPS uses a database of system objects monitored to identify intrusions by analyzing system calls, application logs,
and file-system modifications (binaries, password files, capability databases, and access control lists). 

- The system also checks whether appropriate regions of memory have not been modified. Generally, it does
not use virus patterns to detect malicious software but rather keeps a list of trusted programs.
A program that oversteps its permissions is blocked from carrying out unapproved actions.

- Another benefit of using such system is the need to run and manage
multiple security applications to protect PCs, such as anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewalls.

- Historically HIPS and firewalls are closely related. Where a firewall regulates the traffic to and from your computer based on a rule set,
HIPS do more or less the same, but for the major changes made on your computer.
